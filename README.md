Spark Overflow 

Basic Overview 

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
(If you're looking for a WordPress framework, check out Redux Framework.)
It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

Dependencies 

The dependencies listed are required if you wish to run the library. You can also run script/bootstrap to fetch them all.

Installation 
gem install github-markup


Example Code
Spark also comes with several sample programs in the examples directory. To run one of them, use ./bin/run-example <class> [params]. For example:
./bin/run-example SparkPi will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit examples to a cluster. This can be a mesos:// or spark:// URL, "yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run locally with one thread, or "local[N]" to run locally with N threads. You can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the examples package. For instance:
MASTER=spark://host:7077 ./bin/run-example SparkPi

Running the Project
The easiest way to start using Spark is through the Scala shell:
./bin/spark-shell


Try the following command, which should return 1000:
scala> sc.parallelize(1 to 1000).count()
